## Prompt

so make a short/clear tasks for implementation

## Response

Successfully generated implementation tasks for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course book with 58 specific tasks organized by user story priority:

1. **Phase 1: Setup** (T001-T009): Project initialization and basic structure
2. **Phase 2: Foundational** (T010-T015): Core configuration and templates
3. **Phase 3: [US1] Access Course Materials** (T016-T026): Core content creation (P1 priority)
4. **Phase 4: [US2] Access Weekly Breakdown Content** (T027-T035): Weekly content organization (P1 priority)
5. **Phase 5: [US3] Access Example Code and Deploy** (T036-T043): Code examples and deployment (P2 priority)
6. **Phase 6: [US4] Instructor Access and Tools** (T044-T049): Role-based features (P2 priority)
7. **Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting** (T050-T058): Final optimizations and testing

All tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and descriptions. The MVP approach focuses on User Story 1 first, with parallel execution opportunities identified for content creation and code examples.
