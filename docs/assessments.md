# Assessments

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Evaluate your understanding of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics concepts
- Apply knowledge to solve practical robotics problems
- Demonstrate proficiency in ROS 2, simulation, and Isaac platforms
- Design and implement integrated robotic systems

## Assessment Overview

This assessment module provides various evaluation methods to test your understanding of the course material. Assessments are designed to be both formative (to guide your learning) and summative (to evaluate your mastery).

## Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Assessment

### Knowledge Check
1. Explain the difference between ROS 1 and ROS 2 architecture.
2. Describe the publish-subscribe communication pattern in ROS 2.
3. What is the role of DDS in ROS 2?

### Practical Exercise
Implement a ROS 2 package that includes:
- A publisher node that publishes sensor data
- A subscriber node that processes the sensor data
- A service server that provides data processing
- A launch file that starts all nodes

### Evaluation Criteria
- Code follows ROS 2 best practices
- Proper error handling and logging
- Clear documentation and README
- Successful communication between nodes

## Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Assessment

### Knowledge Check
1. Compare and contrast Gazebo and Unity for robotics simulation.
2. Explain the concept of sim-to-real transfer and its challenges.
3. What is domain randomization and why is it important?

### Practical Exercise
Create a simulation environment that:
- Includes a robot model with sensors
- Contains obstacles and interactive objects
- Implements physics parameters matching real-world properties
- Provides sensor data visualization

### Evaluation Criteria
- Realistic physics simulation
- Accurate sensor modeling
- Proper environment setup
- Successful integration with ROS 2 (if applicable)

## Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) - Assessment

### Knowledge Check
1. Describe the key components of the NVIDIA Isaac platform.
2. Explain how Isaac Sim differs from other simulation environments.
3. What are the advantages of using Isaac ROS packages?

### Practical Exercise
Develop an Isaac application that:
- Implements perception for object detection
- Plans manipulation actions
- Executes grasping behaviors
- Validates performance in simulation

### Evaluation Criteria

- Proper integration of Isaac components
- Performance optimization

## Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Assessment

### Knowledge Check
1. Explain the concept of Vision-Language-Action systems.
2. Compare end-to-end and modular VLA architectures.
3. What are the main challenges in VLA system implementation?

### Practical Exercise
Create a VLA system that:
- Receives natural language instructions
- Perceives the environment using computer vision
- Plans appropriate actions based on the instruction
- Executes the planned actions

### Evaluation Criteria
- Accurate language understanding
- Effective visual perception
- Appropriate action planning
- Successful task completion

## Module 5: Capstone Project - Assessment

### Comprehensive Integration Challenge
Integrate all components learned throughout the course to create an autonomous humanoid robot that:
