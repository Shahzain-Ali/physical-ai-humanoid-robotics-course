# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Course Overview

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course! This comprehensive course book covers the fundamental concepts and practical applications of physical artificial intelligence and humanoid robotics. The course is structured over 13 weeks, progressing from basic principles to advanced implementations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Understand the core principles of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Implement robotic systems using ROS 2
- Create digital twins using simulation environments
- Apply NVIDIA Isaac platform for robot perception and manipulation
- Develop vision-language-action systems
- Design and implement autonomous humanoid robots

## Course Structure

This course is organized into several key modules:

1. **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Understanding robot operating systems
2. **The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Simulation and modeling
3. **The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)** - Perception and decision making
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Multimodal AI systems
5. **Capstone Project** - The Autonomous Humanoid

Each module builds upon the previous one, providing a comprehensive understanding of the field from theory to practice.

## Target Audience

This course is designed for:
- Hackathon participants looking to build advanced robotic systems
- Students and researchers in robotics and AI
- Engineers working on autonomous systems
- Anyone interested in the intersection of AI and robotics

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this course, you should have:
- Basic programming experience (Python preferred)
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with basic robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

## How to Use This Course Book

This course book is designed to be used in conjunction with practical exercises and code examples. Each module includes:
- Theoretical foundations
- Practical implementation guides
- Code examples in ROS 2 and NVIDIA Isaac
- Weekly breakdowns for structured learning

We recommend following the course sequentially, completing the hands-on exercises as you progress through each module.

## Weekly Breakdown

### Weeks 1-2: Introduction to Physical AI

During these foundational weeks, you will explore the core concepts of Physical AI, which combines artificial intelligence with embodied systems. You'll learn about:

- **Definition and scope of Physical AI**: Understanding the intersection of AI and robotics
- **Sensors and perception**: How robots perceive their environment
- **Embodied intelligence**: The concept that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment
- **Hardware considerations**: Overview of robotic platforms and components
- **Safety and ethics**: Fundamental considerations in Physical AI development

### Weeks 3-5: ROS 2 Fundamentals

These weeks focus on ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the middleware that enables communication between different parts of a robotic system:

- **Week 3**: Introduction to ROS 2 architecture, nodes, and topics
- **Week 4**: Services, actions, and parameter management
- **Week 5**: Advanced ROS 2 concepts with rclpy and practical implementations
